/**
 * This class shows a use case of the Factory method pattern design.
 * The Factory Method is a creational design pattern which uses factory methods to deal with the
 * problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
 * This is done by creating objects via calling a factory method either specified in an interface
 * and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by
 * derived classesâ€”rather than by calling a constructor.
